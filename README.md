Chocolate Business Report Dashboard
This dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of the chocolate business's performance, offering insights into sales trends, product popularity, geographical distribution, and individual sales person contributions.

Key Features
1. Overall Performance Metrics
Total Revenue: At a glance, the dashboard displays key performance indicators for total revenue, with a "Sum of Amounts" of 27.99M.

Product-based Metrics: A second "Sum of Amounts" of 2M likely represents a different metric, such as a different time period or a different category.

Date Filter: The dashboard includes a date filter, showing data from 01-01-2023 to 30-09-2024, allowing for analysis within a specific time frame.

2. Sales Trends over Time
The "Sum of Amount by Year and Month" line chart illustrates sales fluctuations over a two-year period (Jan 2023 - Jul 2024).

The chart highlights peak sales months (e.g., July 2023 at 1.62M, April 2024 at 1.62M) and periods of lower performance (e.g., Oct 2023 at 1.09M).

Top Performers: Products like "Orange Choco," "Drinking Coco," and "99% Dark & Pure" are leading sales.

Lower Performers: Products like "Almond Choco," "Milk Bars," and "Caramel Stuffed..." have the lowest sales.

The chart is color-coded to visually distinguish between different product categories or tiers of performance.
